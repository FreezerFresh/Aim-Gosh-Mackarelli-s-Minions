=================================================

Purpose: To work together on a game with a theme of "Freedom"

Team Size: 9. If you don't have 9 people, the project director can choose
which roles to skip.

The project director should create a public GitHub repo and invite his/her
teammates to collaborate on the project. Invite me as well.

Points: 
20 Points (Group) -

Quality of the Game. It needs to have all the pieces
integrated together and available for download on Github. The game must be
fun, have a victory condition, the ability to lose, at least 5 puzzles, a
world map, colors, and a soundtrack. It must represent the tenets of freedom,
which includes the right to life, liberty, property, and free market forces /
Laissez-Faire Capitalism (get rekt Keynes).

By Day 1, all people need to make an initial commit to the
repo stating what their Role is, to the README.md.

20 Points (Individual) -

Person 1: Scrum Lord / Project Leader. You must boss everyone around and make daily reports
to the professor of the progress made that day. You also will write up the
final report which talks about your development process, write the README.md
which will include the documentation of how to play the game. The README needs
colors and images. Explain what each person did on the project, what their
role was, and if they met their individual goals. 

Person 2: JJK Curse Lord. You must use either NCURSES or DearIMGUI to create a
UI for your game

Person 3: Spiderman/Spiderwoman (AKA The Thread Lord): you must use
multithreading in an interesting way, such as handling IO in a separate thread
from the main loop, so the game can run while you process input. You should
use Mutexes and lock_guards

Person 4: DJ Bridges (the artist formerly known as the BRIDGEngineer) you must
make a soundtrack and sound effects for your game in BRIDGES. It's fine if the
user has to open a web page and hit play themselves. You need to make original
music and sound, not plagiarizing.

Person 5: Inheritor of Suffering. You must make a class heirarchy of heroes
and monsters and have a vector of shared_ptrs holding all the actors in the
world. Every actor (the base class) should have a function variable for its
AI. Every game tick, all the actors in the world should run their AI function.
For human controlled actors, the AI function should just return, or you could
have it process the input and move around that way. Your game should have
monsters that wander around the map in real time

Person 6: Socketroth. You must implement networking and either make the game
multiplayer or have some other interesting use for networking. You should have a client/server model where the client will connect to a
server and the server sends updates to the client.

Person 7: Taste Tester / 50 Cent. You must write tests for the other people
that are writing code using G Unit (Google Test Suite). Not all code is
testable, such as UI code, but you can at least look at it and run some QA on
it to make sure all the UI works.

Person 8: Integration Specialization Amalgamation Decimation (ISAD). You must take
the work all the other people do and make a usable game out of it. You are
also responsible for generating a UML diagram showing how all the pieces fit
together. 

Person 9: Screenwriter. Must come up with at least 40 lines of dialogue, 40
lines of environmental description, and a theme/story to the game.

DIALOGUE
- Intro: "You are free. Now free us from our everlasting dreams. You are like us."

- Mercahnt: "You are like me"

- Kori: "Why won't this god awful music turn off!"
- Kori: "Oh, Hi there..."
- Kori: "Can you get me out of here? I'd rather listen to anything besides this music."
- Kori: "It's been going on loop for 17 years. So can you take me with you?"
- Kori: "I'd like to find the source and turn it off, but I can be of use to you."
- Kori: "I can access information about any items you scan. Please just anything to get out of here."
- Kori: "Great, you just need to get to my GNP Chip in the next room. Or the next room... It's somewhere through that door."
- Kori: "I'll open it from here. once you're there you can slot me into your Bio-Suit and I'll intergrade into it."

- Kori: "Okay great! Now that I'm uploaded I can access information about anything you have scanned!"
- Kori: "Did you know the weapon you've been using is from the war with the Kemons?"
- Kori: "Also. I forgot to mention, I'm K.O.R.I., Kemon Observational Reconisance Intelligence."
- Kori: "One of a kind. And nobody thought to turn me off before they left..."
- Kori: "Anyway, let's get going wherever you're going."
- Kori: "Do I have any information about the people on this ship? Well let's see, I should have tons of-"
- Kori: "Well that's strange. I have no information of the residents of this ship or anything about..."
- Kori: "I don't even have knowledge of the planet I was made on."
- Kori: "Everything relating to the people that resided here is gone. I'm sorry. It's all been redacted from my memories and access."
- Kori: "But I know where we can find out! We'll have to get to the Captain's terminal. Plug into there and I'll have access to everything on the ship."
- Kori: "We can get there via the elevator. (So long as it still works...)"

- Kori: "Damn. Looks like it's out of the question. Let's keep looking for another way."

- Kori: "Look! It's a Kemon that's restrained. It must've been here for the last 17 years."
- Chained Kemon: "jir ko tul dahr."
- Kori: "Hold on I'll boot up translations."
- Chained Kemon: "You are like us."
- Kori: "We should help it. 17 years in solitude is no way to treat any creature. Especially with this music."

- Friendly Kemon: "I help go to top floor."

- Kori: "Wow the top floor. I haven't been up here in ages."

- Repeat Announcement: "The day has come. Please prepare for Project Saved to commence. Message will repeat in 5 minutes."
- Kori: "Ooooh I wonder what Project Saved could be."

- Kori: "There's the Captain's key. Now to plug into his terminal."

- Kori: "Alright let's get cracking. Humans... humans... humaaaaans... Oh! Here's a file on Project Saved."
- Kori: "So the Earth is all burnt up. And the people are... Well I guess that explains what happened to everybody. Lets go find that Key."

- Kori: "Hey. Where's the Key? It should be here."
- Kori: "What do you mean this is where you woke up?... Wait... I think your the Key."

- Kori: "Kemons?? What are they doing here?"

- Kori: "Here. I'll translate this. It says, 'Maintain power. They are like us.' What do you think it means?"
- Kori: "Well, no matter. We're here... Wait! You need to know. If you shut down Project Saved... It will kill you."
- Kori: "Please don't- Don't go. You're the only person I've had in so long. And if you leave, I'll be left all alone again with that music. You drown out the noise. Please stay..."
